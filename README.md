Hi, this is my first Discord bot project. In Summary, the bot has 2 funtionalities where: 

1. Text bad jokes with a command.
2. When a user enter a voice channel, the voice enter and play an audio

# Before use the bot:

Create a ".env" file with the following variables:

DISCORD_TOKEN is the bot token. See https://discord.com/developers/applications for more information

+ See the requirements.txt for install the dependences.

# Bot Features

- Jokes customizable in jokes.txt
- Bot Command customizable (The default command is **/eb** but you can change it in config.json)
- You can add many audios at the mp3 folder for playing with **/eb play sound** (withoud the .mp3)
